# Abstract
The 2020 US Presidential election was a highly anticipated and closely contested race between the incumbent President Donald Trump and the challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden. As with most modern elections, social media played a significant role in the campaign, with both candidates using Twitter extensively to reach out to voters and share their messages.
One way that data scientists and researchers can analyze the impact of Twitter on the election is by looking at the number of votes each candidate received in relation to their Twitter activity. For example, if a candidate had a large number of Twitter followers and generated a lot of engagement on the platform, one might expect that they would receive a larger number of votes on election day. Another approach to analyzing Twitter data from the 2020 election is through sentiment analysis, which involves using natural language processing techniques to determine the overall sentiment of a piece of text. By applying sentiment analysis to tweets from the candidates and their supporters, researchers can gain insight into how positively or negatively voters felt about each candidate and their campaign. Overall, the use of Twitter data in the 2020 US Presidential election highlights the increasing importance of data science and digital technologies in the democratic process. By leveraging the vast amounts of data generated on social media platforms, researchers can gain a better understanding of voter sentiment and the impact of online campaigning on election outcomes.
